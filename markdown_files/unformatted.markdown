this text will roughly help you to get to know what immortals can do & how they should do it
when, where, what benefits, etc

## benefits of immortals (short)
(sort by prioritets)
- most of the benefits of immortals are coming from doing daily quests, they give huge exp
- if you will defend the vault daily, and will defend it successfully, then you will receive a big amount of hilts, first place's contribution weekly reward can even be 8000 hilts for example, as well as vault itself can give 700 hilts
- Hilts Trader have a special "Immortals" Tab in which you can buy some more stuff, 2 of which are sigils of dominance which you can contribute, and an additional legendary crest.
-  Kion's Ordeal is also really good, you can get 1 legendary crest on every week there and at least 1 legendary item per run there, ***limited to 1 run per day*** though sometimes we may not have enough essentia to open it so it may not be daily. it's happening at 17:00 and at 21:00 server time. (server time can be visible at bottom left of your screen, at least on the pc, not sure about phone.)

## benefits of immortals (details)


### Kion's Ordeal
when entering Kion's Ordeal, try to party up with some people, and stay nearby your party leader, up to 48 players can join a Kion's Ordeal run, and there will be 4 sides with 4 bosses
top left , top right, bottom left, bottom right, every side can have up to 12 players, so every side can have up to 3 4/4 parties 
try to keep your boss just as damaged as other bosses, basically all 4 bosses should be killed at around the same time,
if you see that your boss is on very low hp - tell people in Zone chat to slow down & do nothing till other people will catch up
if you see some other boss being on very low hp - tell people who's doing it to slow down, e.g. "guys with boss at 30% hp slow down"
if your side is progressing slowly and is very behind, like 80% hp when the other 3 bosses are at 50% - just keep dealing damage! someone from the other 3 sides will notice soon
and he will warn everyone to slow down so you can catch up. ｂ

after killing the boss in Kion make sure to open the chest reward which will be nearby the place where boss have died, then follow the other players to go back to the spawn point,
and stay in a circle of the legendary equipment type which you want

if you will have highest points on your circle - then you will win that item ｂ , it's possible for a single player to win up to 4 times on a circle, 4 rounds of gambling, 
round 1 & round 2 have 4 circles each
round 3 & round 4 have 6 circles each , which means that up to 20 players can win an additional legendary item (on top of a legendary item which is dropped from the boss)
however to let up to 20 players win, the winner will have to leave the circle for the rest of the Kion, that way he can let others to have a better chance to win the item,
because it's possible to win multiple times in a row for a single person.
so maximum number of winners is 20, minimum is 6 , however if you see someone not leaving the circle after winning an item please don't call him out for that,
let's try to keep the whole thing peaceful

### The Vault
it's happening daily at 12:00 - 13:00 and at 19:00 - 20:00 server time
when vault starts, ask in "Immortals" to get invited to the vault or form a party yourself, try to have at least 1 or 2 strong people in your party to have a better time 
during the vault, party leaders should stay in a line after each other, like in supermarket ^^ , this is made to form a reasonable queue and to make sure that everyone will have a chance
to run the vault at least a few times during these 2 hours, when you are last in line just wait for your turn ^^ when you are first in line - go in :3 ,
once you are done with your run - check if there's any open vaults to warn the other people in a line just in case if there's like 5 0/4 vaults and the line is not progressing for some reason
and after checking - go stand after the last person in line, to be the new last person in line 

total amount of opened/in progress vaults can be checked by clicking on the "+" sign on top right of the "x/4" tab
if you see some 2/4 vault opened or 1/4 or 3/4, that means that a party of 1, 2 , or 3 players went in
when 2/4 happens = this means that you can join them either solo or in your own party of 2
when 1/4 happens = this means that you can join him either solo or in a party of 2 or 3 people
and when 3/4 happens this means that you can join them solo
sometimes all immortals are on a cooldown and it may be worth it to go in solo even if you are very weak, just to delay the opponents till a group of 3 stronger people will join
however the need of this is rare, generally happens only at the end of the vault, because on start of the vault strong people can't help because they are on cd and in a party of 4, not 3.
so on start it's better to form a party at all times.
it's also not uncommon to see someone standing right next to The Vault's blue gates, either being afk there or being in someone's party while not being a party leader himself
when that happens try to tell them to move away from the gates, it may help
inside the vault immortals generally try to wait for shadows to clear the whole floor, that way immortals can earn up to ~50 hilts & contribution points
minimum earnings are 0 hilts and 0 contribution (for either dying as a whole party or killing opponents when they haven't killed anything yet)
however if you see that there is only 1 shadow and he is progressing super slow it's ok to try to kill him to finish a bit earlier and to earn 10~20 hilts&contribution points
finishing earlier is also needed when all immortals are on a cooldown and there's like 5 0/4 vaults active, cooldown lasts for 3 minutes.

you also can request a legendary gear from the immortals's vault which you want the most, unfortunately though these gears require a very high level so you will not be able to equip them right away.
you can do up to 1, 2 or 3 gear requests, however it's possible to obtain only 1 item from the ones which you wanted, the other 2 will be random items (that is if you requested 3)
it's also possible to earn only 2 items even if you requested 3 in case if vault didn't had enough of items for every player.
players with highest contribution points are prioritized

once the week have passed, you can receive your weekly rewards for doing the vault in the middle of Hall of Ascension, talk to the npc there & click on receive rewards or something like that.
from the menu of the same npc you also can see one more raid which i'll explain below


### Corvus Expedition 

it happens on Tuesday 18:00 - 18:30 , Thursday 22:00 - 22:30 and Saturday 22:00 - 22:30
it can be started with a minimum of 8 players and a maximum of 30 players
we sometimes have some players on "reserve" which create room at xx:20 or xx:25 & inviting people which were late in the Immortals chat.
during the raid, after receiving the first Iben Fahd's Sanctum's Aspirant's Keys rewards - keep following the npc, and once he stops, make sure to read what text he says
he's choosing ~4 random participants to be the "chosen ones" to charge the portal, if you were named - charge the portal, ignore the enemies which appear all around you, if you die - it's ok
you can respawn on spawn or to wait for someone to revive you & then charge the portal again
if you were not named then you will have to kill the enemies & to protect people which are charging the portal.
after that's done, there will be a quiz, there will be ~3 questions each with 4 possible answers, be careful on that quiz,
because when you pick an answer then your answer is automatically being sent in chat, and other people generally accidentally take it as the right answer & clicking on it too
without realizing that they all may be clicking on the wrong answer, so when you click on an answer, if it shows up as a correct - write in chat that it's correct
if it shows up as wrong - write in chat that it's wrong/not correct
if somebody else picks the answer - ask them in chat if it's correct, do not pick the answer till you get a confirmation
if everyone are running low on time - you can tell in chat that you will randomly pick an answer, and after randomly picking it - write in chat if the answer which you picked is correct or wrong



### Daily quest
all daily quests can be completed solo on Normal difficulty , only Bounties have to be done on Hell 1 difficulty minimum i think, once you are level 60+

### Others
last but not least :3 , we generally contribute our Sigil of Dominance at Sunday, from 03:01 server time till 23:59 server time,
for some strange reason Sunday's 00:00 server time & above counts as Monday already, and rewards contributed at 00:00 & later are going to your next week's contribution
it's a bug because in this game a new day starts at 03:00 server time, not 00:00.
we contribute on sunday because we have x1.2 rewards for doing so on sunday 
but if you need to contribute a single Sigil of Dominance on some other day to complete a daily quest then feel free to contribute it

fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"eu.html#the-vault","fragment":"The Vault\nis held every day at 12:00 - 13:00 and 19:00 - 20:00 server time.\nWhen the treasury starts, ask in the Immortals chat to get an invitation to the vault, or create a group yourself, try to have at least 1 or 2 strong people in your group to get more rewards.\nDuring the treasure room, party leaders should stand in line behind each other like in a supermarket, this is to form a reasonable line and make sure everyone gets a chance to run the vault at least a few times during those 2 hours, when you are last in line, just wait your turn. When you're first in line, get in.\nOnce you finish your run - check to see if there are any vaults open to alert other people in line, just in case there are 5 vaults 0/4 and the queue is not progressing for some reason and after checking - get behind the last person in line to become the new last person in line.\nThe total number of vaults open/passed can be checked by clicking on the \"+\" sign in the upper right corner of the \"x/4\" tab.\nIf you see that 2/4 vaults are open or 1/4 or 3/4, it means that a party of 2, 1 or 3 players have entered the vault.\n2/4 = this means you can join either solo or as part of your party of 2 players\n1/4 = this means you can join either solo or in a party of 2 or 3-\n3/4 = this means you can join them solo\nSometimes all the immortals are in a cooling off period, and it might be worth going solo\nEven if you are very weak, just to hold off opponents until a group of 3 stronger people join, however this is rarely needed, usually only at the end of the vault because at the beginning the strong people can't help because they are on kd and in a party of 4 rather than 3 people.\nThat's why it's always better to form a party at the beginning.\nIt's also not uncommon to see someone standing next to the blue vault gate, either being there in an ash state or being in someone's party but not the party leader himself, in such cases try to tell them to move away from the gate, this might help.\nInside the vault, immortals usually try to wait for shadows to clear the entire floor, this way immortals can earn up to ~50 hpc and contribution points\n\n\n2/4 = this means you can join either solo or as part of your party of 2 players\n\n\n1/4 = this means you can join either solo or in a party of 2 or 3-\n\n\n3/4 = this means you can join them solo\nSometimes all the immortals are in a cooling off period, and it might be worth going solo\n\n\n"});

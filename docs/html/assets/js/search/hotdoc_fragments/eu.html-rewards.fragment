Finish early is also necessary when all immortals are in respawn mode and 5 0/4 vaults are active, the respawn lasts 3 minutes.\nYou can also request the legendary item from the immortal vault that you want the most. Unfortunately, these items require a very high level, so you will not be able to equip them immediately.\nYou can make up to 1, 2 or 3 equipment requests, but you can only get 1 of the items you wanted, the other 2 will be random (this is if you requested 3 items).\nIt is also possible to get only 2 items, even if you requested 3, in case there are not enough items in the vault for each player\nPlayers with the most contribution points get priority\nOnce the week has passed, you can get weekly rewards for completing the quest in the vault in the center of Ascension Hall, talk to the nps and click on \"Get Rewards\"\n"});

fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"unformatted.html#the-vault","fragment":"The Vault\nit's happening daily at 12:00 - 13:00 and at 19:00 - 20:00 server time\nwhen vault starts, ask in \"Immortals\" to get invited to the vault or form a party yourself, try to have at least 1 or 2 strong people in your party to have a better time\nduring the vault, party leaders should stay in a line after each other, like in supermarket ^^ , this is made to form a reasonable queue and to make sure that everyone will have a chance\nto run the vault at least a few times during these 2 hours, when you are last in line just wait for your turn ^^ when you are first in line - go in :3 ,\nonce you are done with your run - check if there's any open vaults to warn the other people in a line just in case if there's like 5 0/4 vaults and the line is not progressing for some reason\nand after checking - go stand after the last person in line, to be the new last person in line\ntotal amount of opened/in progress vaults can be checked by clicking on the \"+\" sign on top right of the \"x/4\" tab\nif you see some 2/4 vault opened or 1/4 or 3/4, that means that a party of 1, 2 , or 3 players went in\nwhen 2/4 happens = this means that you can join them either solo or in your own party of 2\nwhen 1/4 happens = this means that you can join him either solo or in a party of 2 or 3 people\nand when 3/4 happens this means that you can join them solo\nsometimes all immortals are on a cooldown and it may be worth it to go in solo even if you are very weak, just to delay the opponents till a group of 3 stronger people will join\nhowever the need of this is rare, generally happens only at the end of the vault, because on start of the vault strong people can't help because they are on cd and in a party of 4, not 3.\nso on start it's better to form a party at all times.\nit's also not uncommon to see someone standing right next to The Vault's blue gates, either being afk there or being in someone's party while not being a party leader himself\nwhen that happens try to tell them to move away from the gates, it may help\ninside the vault immortals generally try to wait for shadows to clear the whole floor, that way immortals can earn up to ~50 hilts & contribution points\nminimum earnings are 0 hilts and 0 contribution (for either dying as a whole party or killing opponents when they haven't killed anything yet)\nhowever if you see that there is only 1 shadow and he is progressing super slow it's ok to try to kill him to finish a bit earlier and to earn 10~20 hilts&contribution points\nfinishing earlier is also needed when all immortals are on a cooldown and there's like 5 0/4 vaults active, cooldown lasts for 3 minutes.\nyou also can request a legendary gear from the immortals's vault which you want the most, unfortunately though these gears require a very high level so you will not be able to equip them right away.\nyou can do up to 1, 2 or 3 gear requests, however it's possible to obtain only 1 item from the ones which you wanted, the other 2 will be random items (that is if you requested 3)\nit's also possible to earn only 2 items even if you requested 3 in case if vault didn't had enough of items for every player.\nplayers with highest contribution points are prioritized\nonce the week have passed, you can receive your weekly rewards for doing the vault in the middle of Hall of Ascension, talk to the npc there & click on receive rewards or something like that.\nfrom the menu of the same npc you also can see one more raid which i'll explain below\n"});

<p>(to communicate with players from different clans!)</p>
<h2 id="description">Description.</h2>
<p>This text will roughly help you learn what immortals can do and how they should do it, when, where, benefits, etc.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-immortals-summary">Advantages of Immortals (summary)</h2>
<p>(sorted by priority).</p>
<ul>
<li>most immortal benefits are doing daily quests, they give a huge exp.</li>
<li>If you defend the treasury daily, and defend it successfully, you will get a large amount of hilt, the weekly reward for the first place can even be 8000 hilt, for example, the treasury itself can give 700 hilt</li>
<li>The hilt merchant has a special "Immortals" tab where you can buy a few more things, 2 of which are sigils of dominance that you can contribute, and an extra legendary crest.</li>
<li>Kion's Ordeal is also very good, you can get 1 legendary crest each week there and at least 1 legendary item per run , <em><strong>limited to 1 run per day</strong></em>, although sometimes we may not have enough essence to open it, so it may not be daily. it happens at 17:00 and 21:00 server time. (You can see the server time in the bottom left corner of the screen, at least on PC, not sure about phone).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages-of-immortals-details">Advantages of Immortals (details)</h3>
<h3 id="kions-ordeal">Kion's Ordeal.</h3>
<p>When entering Kion's Ordeal try to team up with someone and stay close to the party leader, Kion's Ordeal can have up to 48 players and there will be 4 sides with 4 bosses.</p>
<p>Top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, bottom right, there can be up to 12 players on each side, so there can be up to 3 4/4 games on each side</p>
<p>Try to make sure your boss takes the same damage as the other bosses, basically all 4 bosses should be killed around the same time, if you see your boss has very little xp - tell people in the zone chat to slow down and not do anything until other people catch up with you.</p>
<p>If you see that some other boss has very low xp - tell the people doing it to slow down, such as "guys with a boss at 30% xp slow down".</p>
<p>If your side is progressing slowly and falling far behind, (e.g. 80% xp when the other three bosses have 50% each - just keep doing damage! someone on the other three sides will soon notice this and warn everyone to slow down so you can make up for lost time.</p>
<p>After killing the boss in Kyon, be sure to open the bounty chest near where the boss died, then follow the other players back to the respawn point, and stay in the legendary gear type circle you want to get.</p>
<p>If you have the most points on your circle, you win the item, one player can win up to 4 times
on a round, 4 rounds of the game.
Rounds 1 and 2 have 4 rounds each
Round 3 and Round 4 each have 6 rounds, which means that up to 20 players can win an additional legendary item (in addition to the legendary item that comes off the boss)
However, to allow 20 players to win, the winner will have to leave the round before the end of Kyon, so they can give others a better chance to win the item,
because one person can win several times in a row.
Therefore, the maximum number of winners is 20 and the minimum is 6. However, if you see someone not leaving the circle after winning an item, please don't call them names for that,
let's try to keep things peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="the-vault">The Vault</h3>
<p><u>is held every day at 12:00 - 13:00 and 19:00 - 20:00 server time.</u>
When the treasury starts, ask in the Immortals chat to get an invitation to the vault, or create a group yourself, try to have at least 1 or 2 strong people in your group to get more rewards.</p>
<p>During the treasure room, party leaders should stand in line behind each other like in a supermarket, this is to form a reasonable line and make sure everyone gets a chance to run the vault at least a few times during those 2 hours, when you are last in line, just wait your turn. When you're first in line, get in.</p>
<p>Once you finish your run - check to see if there are any vaults open to alert other people in line, just in case there are 5 vaults 0/4 and the queue is not progressing for some reason and after checking - get behind the last person in line to become the new last person in line.</p>
<p><strong>The total number of vaults open/passed can be checked by clicking on the "+" sign in the upper right corner of the "x/4" tab.</strong></p>
<p>If you see that 2/4 vaults are open or 1/4 or 3/4, it means that a party of 2, 1 or 3 players have entered the vault.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2/4 = this means you can join either solo or as part of your party of 2 players</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/4 = this means you can join either solo or in a party of 2 or 3-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3/4 = this means you can join them solo
Sometimes all the immortals are in a cooling off period, and it might be worth going solo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you are very weak, just to hold off opponents until a group of 3 stronger people join, however this is rarely needed, usually only at the end of the vault because at the beginning the strong people can't help because they are on kd and in a party of 4 rather than 3 people.</p>
<p>That's why it's always better to form a party at the beginning.</p>
<p>It's also not uncommon to see someone standing next to the blue vault gate, either being there in an ash state or being in someone's party but not the party leader himself, in such cases try to tell them to move away from the gate, this might help.</p>
<p>Inside the vault, immortals usually try to wait for shadows to clear the entire floor, this way immortals can earn up to ~50 hpc and contribution points</p>
<h4 id="rewards">Rewards</h4>
<p>0 hpesses and 0 contribution points (for killing the whole party or killing opponents when they haven't killed anything yet),however, if you see that there is only 1 shadow and it advances very slowly, you can try to kill it to finish a little early and earn 10~20 hpesses and contribution points. Finish early is also necessary when all immortals are in respawn mode and 5 0/4 vaults are active, the respawn lasts 3 minutes.</p>
<p>You can also request the legendary item from the immortal vault that you want the most. Unfortunately, these items require a very high level, so you will not be able to equip them immediately.
You can make up to 1, 2 or 3 equipment requests, but you can only get 1 of the items you wanted, the other 2 will be random (this is if you requested 3 items).
It is also possible to get only 2 items, even if you requested 3, in case there are not enough items in the vault for each player
Players with the most contribution points get priority</p>
<p>Once the week has passed, you can get weekly rewards for completing the quest in the vault in the center of Ascension Hall, talk to the nps and click on "Get Rewards"</p>
<h3 id="expedition-corvus">Expedition Corvus.</h3>
<p>Held on Tuesday 6pm - 6:30pm, Thursday 10pm - 10:30pm and Saturday 10pm - 10:30pm.</p>
<p>It can be started by a minimum of 8 players and a maximum of 30 players, sometimes we have a few players in "reserve" who create a room at xx:20 or xx:25 and invite people who are late to the immortal chat.
During the raid, after getting the first Iben Fahd's Sanctum's Aspirant's Keys reward - keep following the npc, and as soon as he stops,
be sure to read what text he says.
<strong>He chooses ~4 random participants as "chosen" to charge the portal, if you have been named - charge the portal, ignore enemies that appear around you, if you die it's no big deal</strong>
You can revive at the spawn or wait for someone to revive you and then charge the portal again.</p>
<p>If you have not been named, you will have to kill enemies and protect the people who charge the portal. After that there will be a quiz, it will have ~3 questions with 4 possible answers, be careful in this quiz because when you choose an answer, your answer is automatically sent to chat and other people usually accidentally mistake it for the right answer and click on it too. not realizing that they can all click on the wrong answer, so when you click on the answer, if it shows up as correct - write in chat that it is correct</p>
<ul>
<li>If it shows up as wrong - write in the chat that it is wrong/wrong</li>
<li>If the answer is chosen by someone else - ask them in the chat if it's correct, don't choose the answer until you get confirmation.</li>
<li>If everyone is short on time - you can say in chat that you will choose an answer at random, and after the answer is chosen at random, write in chat whether you chose the right answer or not.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="daily-quest">Daily Quest</h3>
<p>All daily quests can be done alone on normal difficulty, only Bounty must be done on minimum Hell 1 difficulty, I think once you reach level 60+.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other.</h3>
<p>last but not least,
we usually bring in our Domination Sigil on ==Sunday, between 03:01 server time and 23:59 server time==.</p>
<p>For some weird reason Sunday at 00:00 server time and above is Monday, and any prizes deposited at 00:00 or later go into your tab the following week.
This is a mistake because in this game the new day starts at 03:00 server time, not 00:00.
==We contribute on Sunday because we have x1.2 rewards for doing it on Sunday.== But if you need to contribute one Sigil of Domination on some other day to complete a daily quest, then feel free to contribute it.</p>
